This was a research assignment I completed for my “Intro to Cybersecurity” course at Southern New Hampshire University. 
This research analysis project focused on three major topics around cybersecurity awareness training within a company:

- Identify security gaps or opportunities in training related to human factors
- Identify security gaps or opportunities in training related to legal factors
- Explain why a proactive security mindset is beneficial for all levels of the organization

I drew upon my knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and legal factors to identify gaps within an organization's infrastructure and also suggested a few solutions to close those gaps. 
This analysis not only suggests possible solutions but also promotes a proactive cybersecurity environment for all employees to keep a strong security culture for the organizations. 
A strong cybersecurity awareness training program is essential in the strength of the organization's infrastructure.
